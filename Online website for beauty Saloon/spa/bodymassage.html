<h2><strong>BODY  MASSAGES</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Swedish Massage</strong><pre>Swedish body massage is the  original massage technique involving a sequence of movements working superficially and deeper into the 
tissue layers. The main purpose of Swedish  massage is to increase the oxygen flow in the blood and release toxins from the  muscles. 
Massage helps flush the tissues of harmful deposits such as lactic  acid, uric acid, and other metabolic wastes – improving recovery time from  
muscular strain. Swedish massage also stretches the ligaments and tendons  keeping them supple and pliable, and stimulates the skin and sooth 
the nervous  system at the same time. As a treatment it helps reduce stress, both emotional and physical, and is often suggested in a program
 for stress management. 
It  also has many specific medical uses.<br/>

<p><br /> <strong>Balinese Massage</strong><pre> A Balinese massage uses a combination of gentle stretches,  acupressure and aromatherapy oils to stimulate the flow of blood, 
oxygen and  energy around your body, and bring deep relaxation and wellness. Massage is a rigorous and luxurious spa treatment and a great one
 to choose if you want to  experience a variety of massage techniques, relax and feel spiritually renewed  at the same time. Balinese massage
 is related to the Ayurveda, the Indian  holistic medical system. A relaxation massage with attitude, this treatment  will boost your circulation 
 and give you a deep tissue and muscular massage as  well. <br />

<p><strong>Trigger Point Massage</strong><pre> This treatment puts pressure on certain trigger  points, temporarily stopping blood flow to a particular part of the body, and  
then releasing it, flooding that body part with fresh blood. It sounds weird  and it feels weird too; you realize how powerful your blood is when it surges 
 back into your arteries and the limb feels suddenly warm and strong. This  treatment kick-starts your circulation as it pours and pumpsfresh oxygen  
 around your body. <br />
This massage takes 1hr to complete.</pre>
<p><strong>Deep Tissue Massage</strong><pre>Deep tissue massage is a particularly  effective massage for people with muscular pain. Deep tissue massage helps to  refresh and relax 
muscles, increasing the blood flow and therefore the oxygen  flow around your body. This gets rid of toxins in very sore and strained  muscles, which helps 
them to strengthen and heal. Deep tissue massage is often  used to treat people who are recovering from accidents, and for sports injuries  as it increases 
blood circulation in muscles that are underused, relieves  chronic muscle tension throughout the body, and can also break down scar tissue  and 
&quot;knots&quot; deep in the muscles.<br />
This massage takes 1 hr to complete.</pre>
<p><strong>Aromatherapy Massage</strong><pre>This massage is an ancient science of healing,  relaxing and energizing by the use of plants and their parts.The roots, barks, flowers, fruits, 
seeds and nuts play a crucial part in this massage. The word  aromatherapy is derived from two words aroma which means smell and therapy 
 which stands for healing and overall relaxation and well being.<br />
This massage takes 1 hr to complete.</pre> 
<p><strong>Thai Massage</strong><pre>Thai massage is an ancient Ayurvedic  healing art. Through application of pressure on energy lines and points, and a 
 vast array of passive stretching movements performed with the hands, feet,  knees and elbows, the body experiences profound relaxation, peripheral  
 stimulation of internal organs, increased flexibility and increased flow of  energy. Thai massage is that you get the flexibility, inner organ massage, 
 oxygenation of the blood and quieting of the mind that is attained with yoga.  Through deep muscle stretching, joint release and emphasis on breath, 
 Thai massage offers many of the same benefits as yoga. <br />
