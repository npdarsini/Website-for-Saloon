HOW TO WRITE AN ABSTRACT:
Links and Tips

 

An abstract is a short summary of your completed research. If done well, it makes the reader want to learn more about your research.

These are the basic components of an abstract in any discipline:

1) Motivation/problem statement: Why do we care about the problem?
 What practical, scientific, theoretical or artistic gap is your research filling?

2) Methods/procedure/approach: What did you actually do to get your results?
 (e.g. analyzed 3 novels, completed a series of 5 oil paintings, interviewed 17 students)

3) Results/findings/product: As a result of completing the above procedure, 
what did you learn/invent/create?

4) Conclusion/implications: What are the larger implications of your findings, 
especially for the problem/gap identified in step 1?

However, it's important to note that the weight accorded to the different components
 can vary by discipline. For models, try to find abstracts of research that is similar
 to your research.
