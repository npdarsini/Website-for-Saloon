<h1><strong>FACIALS  AND SKIN TREATMENTS</strong></h1>
                    <img width="139" height="116" src="11.jpg" align="left"/><strong>Diamond Facial</strong><br />
                      The Diamond Facial, a  powerful age-control treatment, is the latest in Shahnaz Husain’s repertoire of  salon procedures. Centuries of practical applications have shown that the  diamond influences the tissues of the human body in a way which facilitates  decongestion and promotes
                      the removal of toxins.  This helps to oxygenate and purify the skin. The most potent effect of the  diamond is its exfoliating and gentle scrubbing action, which helps to diminish  fine lines and wrinkles. It awakens dormant cells and boosts the skin's  metabolic functions. The cellular life of the skin and the regeneration of  healthy new cells are enhanced. Based on Ayurveda, the diamond facial is like  an elixir of youth for timeless eternal beauty.

                      The Gold Facial, based  on Ayurveda, is a powerful anti-ageing treatment, with revitalizing and  rejuvenating effects. Gold is one of the softest metals and is easily absorbed  by the skin. It helps lymphatic drainage and facilitates the removal of toxins  and wastes. It also stimulates blood circulation and improves skin elasticity,  accelerating cell renewal and reversing oxidation damage.</p>

                      The Oxygen Facial  provides instant revitalization, using the most powerful level of natural  energy. It creates an enriched oxygen layer and helps to transport oxygen  molecules directly into the skin. The antibacterial and germicidal action of  Oxygen cream also inhibits bacteria and prevents skin problems. The facial  infuses the skin with essential minerals and natural vitamins, providing ideal  nourishment and bringing visible health, vitality and beauty to the skin.</p>

                      In the Galvanic Facial,  fruit and vegetable juices are used along with other formulations. These are  rich in vitamins, minerals and enzymes. The Galvanic gadget is used, by which a  steady, direct galvanic current is utilized, to introduce these water soluble  substances through the skin. It heightens the skin’s capacity to absorb and  improves the penetration of the products. It has a powerful nourishing and  hydrating action on the skin, leaving it radiant and youthful.</p>

                      Based on Ayurveda, the  Pearl Facial uses products which contain powder of pearls. Research has  revealed that pearls influence the transfer of melanin (natural pigment) to the  skin surface, filtering the sun’s rays and counteracting sun damage. Pearls  also contain powerful nutritive elements, like amino acids, minerals and  proteins, which strengthen the skin and improve its moisture retention ability.  The facial gives way to a healthy radiant skin, with an even colour tone.</p>

                      The Thermoherb Mask is a  mini face-lift, which deep cleanses, restores balances and tightens the skin.  Based on an ancient thermal mask, it has been improved with herbal extracts.  The mask hardens, generates heat and creates the ideal temperature between  itself and the skin, at which skin absorption is highly efficient. As it  hardens, it tightens the pores, sculpting the facial contours, minimizing  wrinkles and improving skin elasticity. The Thermoherb mask itself contains  extracts of rose, basil and mint.</p>
