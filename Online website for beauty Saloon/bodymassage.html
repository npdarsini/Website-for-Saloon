<p><strong>BODY  MASSAGES</strong>
<p><strong>Swedish Massage</strong> :-Swedish body massage is the  original massage technique involving a sequence of movements working  superficially and deeper into the tissue layers. The main purpose of Swedish  massage is to increase the oxygen flow in the blood and release toxins from the  muscles. Massage helps flush the tissues of harmful deposits such as lactic  acid, uric acid, and other metabolic wastes – improving recovery time from  muscular strain. Swedish massage also stretches the ligaments and tendons  keeping them supple and pliable, and stimulates the skin and sooth the nervous  system at the same time. As a treatment it helps reduce stress, both emotional  and physical, and is often suggested in a program for stress management. It  also has many specific medical uses.<br/>

<p><br /> <strong>Balinese Massage</strong> :- A Balinese massage uses a combination of gentle stretches,  acupressure and aromatherapy oils to stimulate the flow of blood, oxygen and  energy around your body, and bring deep relaxation and wellness. Massage is a  rigorous and luxurious spa treatment and a great one to choose if you want to  experience a variety of massage techniques, relax and feel spiritually renewed  at the same time. Balinese massage is related to the Ayurveda, the Indian  holistic medical system.

<p><strong>Trigger Point Massage</strong> :- This treatment puts pressure on certain trigger  points, temporarily stopping blood flow to a particular part of the body, and  then releasing it, flooding that body part with fresh blood. It sounds weird  and it feels weird too; you realize how powerful your blood is when it surges  back into your arteries and the limb feels suddenly warm and strong. This  treatment kick-starts your circulation as it pours and pumps fresh oxygen  around your body. <br />

<p><strong>Deep Tissue Massage</strong> :-  Deep tissue massage is a particularly  effective massage for people with muscular pain. Deep tissue massage helps to  refresh and relax muscles, increasing the blood flow and therefore the oxygen  flow around your body. This gets rid of toxins in very sore and strained  muscles, which helps them to strengthen and heal. Deep tissue massage is often  used to treat people who are recovering from accidents, and for sports injuries  as it increases blood circulation in muscles that are underused, relieves  chronic muscle tension throughout the body, and can also break down scar tissue  and &quot;knots&quot; deep in the muscles.<br />

Thai massage is that you get the flexibility, inner organ massage,  oxygenation of the blood and quieting of the mind that is attained with yoga.
